            <strong>Step One:</strong> Make an appointment for your procedure. Here is a <a href="./clinics.php">list of area clinics which can help you</a>. This list does not include any pro-life “crisis-pregnancy centers”; these centers are dedicated to convincing you to choose other alternatives and may not present all your options accurately or fully.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step Two:</strong> Your clinic will help you find out how far along your pregnancy is. They will ask you for the date of the first day of your last menstrual period and they may ask you to come in for a pregnancy test before scheduling your procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
