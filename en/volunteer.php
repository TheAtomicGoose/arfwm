        ARFWM provides funding to women and girls seeking abortion care who cannot afford it. Safe, legal, dignified abortions are an essential part of women's health care, but they are out of reach for many.
        <br><br>
        We are a community-based, all-volunteer organization dedicated to overcoming the economic barriers to abortion care. Our committed volunteers give their time and individual donors give their financial support because they know that without money, a right is meaningless.
        <br><br>
        Please call us at 413-582-3532 if you have questions or would like to volunteer.
