            <strong>Step One:</strong> Make an appointment for your procedure. Here is a <a href="./clinics.php">list of area clinics which can help you</a>. This list does not include any pro-life "crisis-pregnancy centers"; these centers are dedicated to convincing you to choose other alternatives and may not present all your options accurately or fully.

            <strong>Step Two:</strong> Your clinic will help you find out how far along your pregnancy is. They will ask you for the date of the first day of your last menstrual period and they may ask you to come in for a pregnancy test before scheduling your procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step Three:</strong> For financial help, call us and leave a message with your first name, your telephone number, and whether we can leave a message for you. Please call us at <strong>413-582-3532</strong>. Your call is confidential, and we will return your call within 24 hours.

        If you are under the age of 18 and seeking abortion care in Massachusetts, you will need parental permission or a judicial bypass (permission from a judge). Your clinic can help you decide what's best for your situation and will provide information about the judicial bypass process.
        <br><br>
        We will work with your regardless of your citizenship or immigration status.

        We are here to help you. We know that if someone can't afford an abortion, then it isn't available.
